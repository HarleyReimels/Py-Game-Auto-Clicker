# Exploring Pygame, OpenCV, Pynput
Creating a small game to try out some of the main features of these libraries to familiarize myself with them.

## Current development
Currently developing a game where black tiles fall down from the top of the screen. If they pass the bottom of the screen without being clicked then you lose. If it is clicked the score
is incremented and the tile disappears. This game was inspred by the mobile game Piano Tiles.

## Future Development
Once the game is finished I would like to look into reading the current status of the screen. OpenCV may be overkill, so other methods are optional.
Once The screen input has been read, have pynput click on black tiles. Repeat N number of times.
